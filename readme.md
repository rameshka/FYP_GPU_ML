<h1 align="center">Machine Learning to identify OpenMP GPU suitability</h1>

##About
This is a sub-project of the main project <b>Performance Tradeoffs of Pragma-Based Parallel Programming Models</b>
found [here](https://github.com/PasinduSenanayake/Rigel-FYP).</br>
In this projet we try to develop a machine Learning model capable of predicting(suitability) of OpenMP GPU offloading using a set of miro-architecture independant features. These features will reflect the nature of the program. further we try to predict suitability of GPU offloading by features extracted from the CPU execution.
